My Q1 project is called Lingua Franca. It's a tool for language translation that automatically generates flashcards every time the user looks up a word or phrase. This is especially useful for people who are traveling in other countries and want to quickly look up words and phrases and be able to go back and review later in time.

My project solves this problem by implementing a two-state application designed primarily for mobile users. The first state is a 'translate mode' that allows a user to select from a list of origin languages and destination languages and then get translations for whatever text they input. The second state is a 'review mode' which allows users to run through all of the translations that they have already looked up. For every language pair (origin/destination) that the user looks up in translation mode, the application creates a 'deck' containing all translations in those languages.

I am using the Yandex.Translate API for my translations. In addition, I am using HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, and Materialize. The most valuable customer feedback I received was that my initial page was confusing. Having a fresh set of eyes on my project made it clear that I needed to provide more clues to the user about how to use my application.

The biggest challenge was figuring out how to structure and re-structure my program as it evolved and became more complex. Every time I added a new feature, I would realize how changing things in one state could affect the appearance or functionality of the program in another state.
